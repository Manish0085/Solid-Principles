Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

  Defination: the single responsibility principle says that A class should have only one reason to change. It means that a class should have single resposibility.
  Problem: A class handles multiple responsibility (e.g. business logic and the repository bothe are in same class).
  Solution: Split the responsibility in saperate classes. Each class focuses on the single task or single responsibility

  Example: MarkerPrinter class prints the marker details only.
           SaveMarkerToDB class saves the mmarker to Db only.
